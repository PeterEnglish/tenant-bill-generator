# tenant-bill-generator

## This is a class-based python pdf-bill generator that allows you generate pdfs of rent due per person per household. It dynamically inserts data about the occupants including their name and the amount the owe, the name of the property, and the date for which the rent is owed. Most of this project is class-based, and there are seperate objects for bill calculation and pdf generation.

## Future Contributions
I would like to create a tkinter gui that allows you to enter new tenants on a per-household basis, and also new households.
I also think that having a database-based back end would be a good idea, with a file store of pictures of the house condition and the point of commencement of tenancy.
